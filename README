Simple App to load and store data from CSV file at SQLite database.

- Use application *importData.py* to transfers `task_data.csv` to a database
- Use *visualization.py* for a web application for connect and visualize this database

To load data from CSV just replace csv file from folder and execute.
`python importData.py`

After this step you can see data using:
`python importData.py`

And then go to browser and access address:
`http://127.0.0.1`

You can see detail of measurement click at number at `id column`.

Technology and Justification
Database: 
    - SQLite. I chose this because is very small, fast and easy to solve this demand.
    - For this project i wrote SQL's query like text to show my knowledge but it can work with SQLAlchemy too.

WEB: 
    - Flask and Jinja2. 
    - Small, realiable and fast to solve it.

I tried to create a auto solve app. So if don't exists a database it going to create database and the schema too.
